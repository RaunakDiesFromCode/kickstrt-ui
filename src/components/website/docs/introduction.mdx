<DocsLayout title={meta.title} description={meta.description}>
**Kickstrt UI is not just a component library — it’s how you build your UI your way.**

Most component libraries work like this: you install a package, import the components, and use them. This works fine until you need to:

- Adapt a component to match your design system
- Change styles beyond simple color adjustments
- Introduce a component that isn’t included

Often, developers end up wrapping components, writing style overrides, or juggling multiple libraries with inconsistent APIs. Kickstrt UI solves this by giving you full control over your components while keeping development fast and modular.

Kickstrt UI is built around these core principles:

- **Open Code:** Full access to the component code for complete control.
- **Composition:** Predictable, composable interfaces for every component.
- **Customizable Styles:** Beyond colors, tweak spacing, typography, or any design token.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Ready-to-use components that look great out-of-the-box.
- **Developer-First:** Includes dev showcases for quick prototyping and testing.

## Open Code

Kickstrt UI gives you the actual component code. You can modify or extend anything to fit your needs. This approach ensures:

- **Transparency:** You see exactly how each component is built.
- **Easy Customization:** Adjust styles, behavior, or functionality directly.
- **AI-Friendly:** Open code that LLMs can read, understand, and even enhance.

_Typical libraries require wrapping or overriding for minor changes. With Kickstrt UI, you just edit the component directly._

        Kickstrt UI uses a modular, headless architecture. Core dependencies can be updated separately while your top-layer code remains fully customizable.

        The topmost layer of each component is independent, letting you integrate updates without losing your design-specific modifications.

## Composition

Every Kickstrt UI component shares a predictable, composable interface. Missing a component? Add it, make it composable, and integrate it seamlessly with your design system.

_A consistent API means your team and AI tools don’t have to relearn a new interface for every component._

## Customizable Styles

Kickstrt UI lets you go beyond color changes. Modify spacing, typography, shadows, or any design token directly in the component code:

- **Fine-Grained Control:** Tailor every aspect of your UI without hacks.
- **Reusable Design System:** Changes propagate consistently across all components.
- **Rapid Iteration:** Experiment in dev showcases before committing to production.

## Beautiful Defaults

Kickstrt UI comes with thoughtfully-designed default styles, so your UI looks clean and polished immediately:

- **Out-of-the-Box:** Ready-to-use components that just work.
- **Unified Design:** Components naturally fit together.
- **Easy Overrides:** Default styles can be extended or replaced entirely.

## Developer-First

Kickstrt UI includes showcases for every component, letting you:

- Quickly prototype and test features
- Explore component APIs interactively
- Experiment with style customizations in a live environment

_Kickstrt UI empowers developers to build, iterate, and scale UI components with speed and precision._
